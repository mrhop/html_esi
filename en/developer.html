                                    <p>ESI Group is owned and running by Tucher family. Tucher family is one of the
                                        oldest and richest family in Germany. Since 700 years ago, Tucher family started
                                        the business with nothing, till now they have already become the most effective
                                        family, from local company to a global one.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Since 1503, Tucher Funding was built. Till now Tucher family has accumulated the
                                        experience in constructions for more than 500 years. We brought our rich
                                        experience and technics into China through the project of Noble Mansion.</p>

                                    <p style="clear: both;">Tucher family has a deep fate with China. In middle century,
                                        Tucher family
                                        brought cloth and spice trade into China via the Silk Road. Now, we brought all
                                        kinds of projects to China those related to constructions, environment and
                                        energy. Besides, Noble Mansion will be the new symbol and witness for the
                                        friendship between China and Germany.</p>
